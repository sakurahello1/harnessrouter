# Harness support matrix

The run's notes, per column, are in [support-matrix-notes.md](support-matrix-notes.md).

Scenarios: first turn, follow-up in the same session, switch model mid-session, artifact (a file the task must produce), recycle (the sandbox is let go on purpose, then a follow-up must recall the first message). pass = ran and answered as asked, FAIL = failed (reason in the notes), n/a = not run.
