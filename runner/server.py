"""In-sandbox harness runner server — multi-backend, multi-provider.

Runs INSIDE an ACA Dynamic Sessions custom-container sandbox (one per session, Hyper-V
isolated, warm-pooled). The `harness-gateway` allocates a session from the pool and proxies
turn requests here. The agent ALWAYS works on a real local POSIX git working tree at
/workspace with real bash + git — its native, trained environment (we never map VectorGraph
into the session; see docs/technical/HARNESS_AS_A_SERVICE_DESIGN.md S0.5).

A turn runs ONE backend CLI one-shot over /workspace and normalizes its events into a
single canonical schema (Claude Code `stream-json`) so everything downstream is uniform.

Backends + providers (registry-driven — pi was added as exactly that one entry):
  backend "claude" (Claude Code CLI), providers:
    - anthropic   : ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (+ optional ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL)
    - bedrock     : CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 + AWS creds/bearer + region
    - vertex      : CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 + project/region + SA-JSON
    - tokenrouter : ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<router> + ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
  backend "codex" (OpenAI Codex CLI), providers (config.toml [model_providers.*]):
    - openai      : api.openai.com/v1, OPENAI_API_KEY
    - azure       : <azure>/openai/v1, AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY (wire_api=responses)
    - tokenrouter : <router base_url>, ROUTER_API_KEY
  backend "hermes" (NousResearch hermes-agent CLI; events tailed from its state.db —
  multi-family: runs any frontier model through the matching provider connection):
    - azure-foundry : AZURE_FOUNDRY_API_KEY + AZURE_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL (gpt family)
    - bedrock       : AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK (or key pair) + AWS_REGION (claude family)
    - anthropic     : ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (+ optional ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL)
  backend "dsh" (DeepSeek Harness; official Python SDK drives the bundled JSON-RPC
  runtime — runner/dsh_driver.py re-emits its session.events as NDJSON):
    - deepseek    : any OpenAI-compatible deepseek-family endpoint; DEEPSEEK-shaped auth
                    goes to the driver as HR_DSH_* and stays OUT of the runtime env
  backend "pi" (earendil-works pi coding agent; `pi -p --mode json` event stream,
  multi-family like hermes — custom providers via ~/.pi/agent/models.json):
    - anthropic     : ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (native), base_url via models.json when set
    - openai        : OPENAI_API_KEY (native), base_url via models.json when set
    - azure         : models.json openai-responses + base_url
    - openai-api    : models.json openai-completions + base_url (generic aggregator)
    - tokenrouter   : models.json, api by model family (claude -> anthropic-messages)

Creds are injected per-session via env (pool secrets) or a body `auth` override for spikes.
Phase 0b: buffered turn. SSE streaming, git hydrate/commit, mid-turn /input, and the Node
Yjs sidecar layer on next.

    """Make a codex rollout safe to replay, without destroying any of it.

    Two hazards live in the same file, and the fix for one used to create the other.

    1. ACCOUNT BINDING. A reasoning item carries `encrypted_content` (the `gAAA…` chain-of-thought
       blob) that only the account which minted it can decrypt. A follow-up served by a DIFFERENT
       account (chain fallback, key rotation, a load-balanced proxy) 400s with
       `invalid_encrypted_content`, and because the item stays in the rollout, EVERY later resume
       fails identically — a permanently wedged session.

    2. REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY. Against a provider that stores responses (codex sends `store: true`
       to Azure Responses endpoints), an item `id` replayed in `input` is a REFERENCE into
       server-side state. The server looks up the response that minted it and requires its
       siblings. Delete the reasoning item but keep the `msg_…` that was minted beside it and the
       reference dangles:
           Item 'msg_…' of type 'message' was provided without its required 'reasoning' item: 'rs_…'
       Deterministic, not flaky: every follow-up replays at least one such item, so the first turn
       succeeds and every one after it fails.

    This function previously deleted whole reasoning lines to solve (1), which is precisely what
    caused (2). It no longer deletes anything. The two concerns turn out to be separable: the
    `encrypted_content` is what the ACCOUNT owns, the `id` is what the SERVER checks, so keeping
    the item while dropping the blob satisfies both.

    So:
      - reasoning items are KEPT, with their `id`, minus `encrypted_content`;
      - a rollout already damaged by the old behaviour (id-bearing items, no reasoning left to
        anchor them) is repaired by removing `id` from every provider-minted item, which turns the
        replay into ordinary content the server does not try to resolve. `call_id`, `phase`,
        `role`, `content`, `name` and `arguments` are preserved, so tool pairing and transcript
        survive. Half-measures do not work here: leaving an id on any one item type just moves the
        error to that type.

    Never deletes a line and never changes the line count, so it is idempotent and cannot shift a
    byte offset that a future codex version might project history from.

    Returns counts for logging: {"reasoning": n_blobs_dropped, "deref": n_ids_removed,
                                 "damaged": n_files_repaired}.

# message may carry `content: ""`, and TokenRouter's OpenAI→Anthropic translation forwards that
# as an empty text content block, which Anthropic refuses — 'HTTP 400: messages: text content
# blocks must be non-empty', captured 2026-08-20 by conformance X-05 on claude-haiku-4.5, and
# intermittent because whether a given tool-call message carries empty content is up to the
# model (issue #12). Nothing sat between hermes and the provider to repair it, and the failure
# killed the turn: a 400 is never retried, and re-running on the next chain connection re-runs
# the whole task. So the openai-api path now routes through the same kind of loopback relay the
# dsh backend already has (runner/dsh_driver.py): requests are normalized BEFORE the provider
# sees them — prevention, not retry — and as with dsh, the real credential stays in this
# process; hermes gets a placeholder token the relay resolves per request, so the key never
# enters the CLI's env, its state.db, or anything it could checkpoint.
#
# One shared server, routes resolved from the placeholder bearer token: hermes is spawned per
# turn with a fresh env, so each turn registers its upstream and the entry simply outlives the

    block for it), and empty `{"type": "text", "text": ""}` parts are dropped from list-shaped
    content (if that empties a tool-call message's list, it becomes null too). An EMPTY
    `reasoning_content` is deleted outright: qwen-code echoes DeepSeek's extension field back
    verbatim, and LLMTR's validator requires it non-empty when present ('String must contain at
    least 1 character(s)', measured live on deepseek-v4-pro 2026-08-27 — the turn died right
    after its tool call). A non-empty one is meaningful interleaved thinking and passes through.
    A top-level `reasoning_effort: null` is deleted: kimi sends the key with a null value on every
    request, and Vercel's AI Gateway answers that with HTTP 400 ("Invalid option: expected one of
    \"none\"|\"minimal\"|…", measured twice in one live turn on 1.50.0), so on that gateway every
    kimi turn would fail before it began. Null is not one of the enum's options, and a client that
    sends it means "unset" — deleting it says the same thing in a shape every endpoint accepts.
    Only null is touched; a real effort value is the caller's choice and passes through, as does

    tool_result_serde in crates/goose-provider-types/src/conversation/). One JSON object per line.

    TWO NAMING CONVENTIONS IN ONE STREAM, and getting either wrong is silent:
      - the top-level event tag is snake_case  (#[serde(tag="type", rename_all="snake_case")]):
            message | notification | error | complete
      - the content-block tag is camelCase     (#[serde(tag="type", rename_all="camelCase")]):
            text | thinking | redactedThinking | toolRequest | toolResponse | error

        message:      {type, message:{id, role:"user"|"assistant", created, content:[…], metadata}}
        toolRequest:  {type:"toolRequest", id, toolCall:{status:"success", value:{name, arguments}}}
                      — the call is TWO levels down, under toolCall.value, and `status` is Rust's
                      Result rendered by tool_result_serde: on failure it is
                      {status:"error", error:"<string>"}, a string and not an object.
        toolResponse: {type:"toolResponse", id, toolResult:{status, value:<CallToolResult>}}

        error:        {type:"error", error:"<string>"} — emitted by handle_agent_error, which also
                      ends the run, so unlike gemini's non-fatal `error` this one IS terminal.
                      NOT the only way a turn fails: a provider error is narrated as assistant
                      text instead, and only _GOOSE_ERR_RE catches that one.

    The served model rides message.metadata.inference: {provider, requestedModel, resolvedModel}

# ── hermes driver — DB-polling turn runner ───────────────────────────────────────
# hermes-agent emits no event stream on stdout, but flushes every message (assistant text,
# OpenAI-style tool_calls, tool results) incrementally into $HERMES_HOME/state.db during the run.
# This driver spawns the CLI, tails that table, and synthesizes the same canonical claude
# stream-json events the other backends produce, so everything downstream stays uniform.
_HERMES_POLL_S = 0.8
# A fresh (non-resume) turn's cursor stays at "no session row yet" until the hermes CLI itself
# writes one to state.db — the driver has NO other progress signal before that. If the subprocess
# blocks on an unbounded network call (provider auth/model init) before ever reaching that write,
# the turn shows zero events with no error, indistinguishable from "still working," for as long as
# MAX_TURN_SECONDS / the caller's timeout_seconds allows (hours by default). This is a SEPARATE,
# much shorter bound on just that startup window, independent of the overall per-turn cap.
#
# "Started" means THE MODEL PRODUCED SOMETHING, not merely that a session row appeared. Those are
# different moments: hermes writes the session and echoes the user's prompt before it calls the
# provider, so keying the guard on the session row disarmed it a fraction of a second in, and a
# CLI that then produced nothing at all was left to run against the six-hour cap — the console
# showing "Working…" the whole time. Observed with z-ai/glm-5.2 on hermes 0.19.0, which returns a
# clean stream when called directly (2.2s, content "ok") and hangs inside the CLI after it.
#
# A tool call that legitimately runs for minutes is NOT affected: hermes writes the assistant
# message carrying the tool call before executing it, so output exists and the guard is disarmed.
