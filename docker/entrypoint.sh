#           CAP_CHOWN are in Docker's default set: no --privileged, no --cap-add.
#   agent   the product: the gateway, the console, the data volume. Its databases, blobs and
#           secret store are readable by it alone.
#   20000+  one uid per session, owning its session directory and nothing else. It cannot read or
#           write another session's workspace, the workspace parent, the databases, the blobs or
#           the secret store: a deliverable written to any of those paths fails at the write, while
#           the model is still there to choose the right one, instead of vanishing. Shared scratch
#           (/tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm) stays writable, because tools hardcode it — see the mode

#
# Pinned EXACTLY, like every other backend here. Upstream ships weekly (1.49.0 -> 1.50.0 in five
# days) and 1.50.0 is the release runner/server.py's goose code was written against: the
# stream-json event schema, GOOSE_PATH_ROOT, the available_tools allowlist and -n/-r resume were
# all read out of THIS version's source. A silent `latest` re-gambles all of it.
#
# Note the repo moved from block/goose to aaif-goose/goose. Unlike omp this project publishes no
# SHA256SUMS.txt, so there is nothing to fetch and compare against — but that does not mean the
# download has to go unverified: the digests are pinned HERE instead, computed from the v1.50.0
# release assets (each archive holds exactly ./goose). That is strictly stronger than the tag

# not share the runner's interpreter. The version is pinned exactly and aider's own wheel pins every
# dependency to a version, so the venv is the same one on every volume; there is no digest check
# here, the release is trusted the way the other PyPI installs (dsh) are.
#
# NOTE the Python floor: aider 0.86.2 declares Requires-Python <3.13,>=3.10. On an interpreter
# outside that range pip does not fail — it silently offers an OLDER aider (0.82.3 was the highest
# on 3.9), and every behaviour runner/aider_driver.py was written against would be absent without a
# single error. The explicit version pin below is what turns that into a hard failure.

# OpenHands V1, MIT (OpenHands/agent-sdk), pinned to 1.49.2 — the AGENT SERVER, not the CLI.
#
# PyPI `openhands` is OpenHands/openhands-cli, whose README opens with "This project is no longer
# actively maintained" and whose last release is 1.16.0 of 2026-05-08. This is the interface its
# vendor does maintain: `openhands-agent-server`, released 1.49.2 on 2026-09-17.
#
# THE THREE PINS GO IN ONE pip INVOCATION, and that is not cosmetic. `openhands-agent-server`
# imports `openhands.tools` and `libtmux` at module level and declares NEITHER; `openhands-tools`
# is what brings both. Installed one at a time, pip resolves each call on its own and lands on
# browser-use 0.13.10, which pins `openai==2.26.0` against the server's own `openai>=2.33.0` — a
# set `pip check` refuses. Given all three at once it backtracks to browser-use 0.11.13 and the
# environment is consistent (verified: `No broken requirements found`, and the same resolution uv
# reaches). The 1.34.0 set the OpenHands platform itself declares does not resolve at all
# (`ResolutionImpossible`, lmnr against openhands-sdk), so 1.49.2 is the floor as well as the pin.
#
# THE FOURTH PIN IS litellm, HELD BELOW 1.95.0, and it decides whether a follow-up turn survives.
# The SDK asks only for `litellm>=1.93.0`, so pip takes the newest — and from 1.95.0 litellm's
# PromptTokensDetailsWrapper mirrors an assignment between `cache_write_tokens` and
# `cache_creation_tokens`, which puts BOTH names into `model_fields_set` and then drops the unset
# attribute from __dict__. The SDK's telemetry (llm/utils/telemetry.py, _cache_buckets) reads
# `"cache_creation_tokens" in details.model_fields_set` as its existence test, so it asks for an
# attribute that is no longer there: `AttributeError: 'PromptTokensDetailsWrapper' object has no
# attribute 'cache_creation_tokens'`. Each side is self-consistent; together they are not, and
# 1.49.2 is the newest SDK, so there is nothing to upgrade to.
#
# It only fires once a response carries prompt_tokens_details — a prompt-cache hit, which a FIRST
# turn cannot have — so it reads as "follow-ups fail and first turns do not". The agent-server
# publishes no error event for it (see the driver's fallback), tenacity retries it five times, and
# the record shows a 150-200 s turn that ended for no stated reason. Measured on gemini-3-flash-preview,
# same command and image, litellm the only difference: 1.101.0 gave first ok / follow-up FAIL 145 s /
# switch ok / artifact FAIL 175 s / recycle FAIL 148 s, and 1.94.3 gave five of five in 10-14 s each.
#
